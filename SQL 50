+----------------+---------+
transaction_id is column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.
 

Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

#code
select v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) as count_no_trans 
from Visits v
left join Transactions t on v.visit_id = t.visit_id
where transaction_id is null
group by customer_id

#Output
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

Q9/Rising Temperature

Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+

| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

#code (self join)
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
join Weather w2
ON DATEDIFF (w2.recordDate ,w1.recordDate ) = -1
AND w1.temperature>w2.temperature  

#Output

Q10/ Average Time of Process per Machine

Table: Activity

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
 

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.


# Code (self join)
select a1.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp),3) AS processing_time 
from Activity a1
join Activity a2 
on
a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id
and
a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and
a1.timestamp<a2.timestamp
group by a1.machine_id

#Output
| machine_id | processing_time |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

empId is a foreign key (reference column) to empId from the Employee table.
Each row of this table contains the id of an employee and their respective bonus.
 

Write a solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus less than 1000.

# code (left join)
select e.name, b.bonus
from Employee e
left join Bonus b
on 
  e.empId=b.empId 
where
b.bonus<1000
or b.bonus is null

#Output
| name | bonus |
| ---- | ----- |
| Brad | null  |
| John | null  |
| Dan  | 500   |
